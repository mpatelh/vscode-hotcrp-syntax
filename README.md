# HotCRP review form syntax highlighting

No-nonsense syntax highlighting targeting the "offline review forms" generated
by [HotCRP](https://www.hotcrp.com/). Highlighting these is very useful in order
to differentiate auto-generated prompt text from your own additions.

The boilerplate text is highlighted as a comment while the remaining text is
treated as Markdown syntax.
